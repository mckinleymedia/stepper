# Stepper component

_A component to enable stepping through scenes on a d3 chart_

This component uses Redux. To enable, it must be wired up to any ap. Mostly that means combining the Stepper reducer with the app's reducer.

I've used the following libraries to get this working:

# redux

# reactStrap - a react bootstrap library

I could certainly par down these libraries - this is my first swing at it.
